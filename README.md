# Apollo: A Powerful, Object-Oriented, Lighthearted Language Option
### Written by Joshua Shterenberg

## Overview and How to Build

Apollo is the brainchild of a week's worth of boredom, too much coffee,
and a bored computer programmer during a college winter intersession.
It is a custom-built programming language, compiled and interpreted
through python, designed with the vision of an alternative to the 
operative basis that languages such as "C" or "BASIC" ordinarily
provide, with (hopefully) a bit more flare and fun infused along the 
way.

The current iteration of this project is in a beta state. To build this
project, simply download all of the files needed to correctly build:
* apollo.py
* shell.py
* All other necessary files in the import of apollo.py

Then, simply execute the main project file. Insure that, prior to 
execution, you have the most updated version of Python3 installed.
Below is a sample run of the current beta version of the project:
```
MyTerminal$ python3 shell.py
>>> 2 + 5
7
>>> 6 + 9 * 2
24
>>> (6 + 9) * 2
30
```
